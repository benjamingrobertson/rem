      Thanks for visiting my website! As of September 3rd, 2018, my website is no longer operational. RobynEMiller.com is very operational! I began working for Limestone College in October of 2017. I resonate deeply with the mission of Limestone College, which is to provide a liberal arts education to diverse populations. In my role at Limestone, I have many opportunities for mentoring, advising, and civic engagement.
